# Assignment

## Objectives

By the end of this project you will:

- clone a Github project.

## Introduction - How to run our Movie Quotes App

Our intern Dan worked on this killer Movie Quotes App that returns a random movie quote.

In order to get this app to work, please do the following:

 - Write "npm install" on your terminal - This will allow our package manager to install all dependencies, including our quote generator.
 - Write "node index.js" on your terminal - Our app will start a server and is listening for connections, specifically port 3000.
 - In your web browser, write "http://localhost:3000/" - We can now see our app. Feel free to refresh to see more movie quotes!
